who_is_streaming_ios
====================

I'm teaching myself iOS and Objective C, and I thought a Twitch integrated viewing app would be a fun project.

This iOS application will utilize the official Twitch API, and pull down data for the top 100 currently streaming users. This application will allow users to see who is streaming, and actually view the stream through the app if they choose to. In addition, data pertaining to the currently stream will also get displayed to the user (viewers, username, game, status, etc...).

Please feel free to check out the official Twitch API documentation [HERE](https://github.com/justintv/Twitch-API).

TODO
====

* Need to figure out the interface tweaking between device sizes!
* Add content to the modal segue from the root controller.
* ???
